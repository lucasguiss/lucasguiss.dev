the main goal of this portfolio/personal website/blog is to try new things, overengineer this application and use it to keep a routine of programming/journaling
i'll just write whatever comes to my mind in the tech subjects so you should be expecting some grammar errors, informal writing and bad jokes

## why i chose next.js

i have been working with next and react for the last months in my current job so i decided to step up my game and research some more about it's power and i find out that
it is as amazing as every react preacher says, i'm pretty happy with how easy it is to setup a new project and start developing new features

## we need to talk about styling

also one of the main reasons i chose next/react for this project and for my main study goal in 2025 is the integration with shadcn and tailwind
it amazed me how i am able to use pretty much everything out of the box from thesed libraries without any kind of major effort setting up everything


## next steps

this first post is very experimental and i am still trying to adapt to write my thoughts on the internet, but i'm basically hoping to:
- add dark/light mode support (even tho it's already using the tailwind classes i still need to setup the next-themes or something like that)
- add some i18n configuration for the posts to have in english and portuguese for all my brazillian fans which are currently my cat, dog and fiance (i hope)
- create an insane pipeline with n8n or any workflow automation tool to just get the post from notion or obsidian so i don't have to commit a new .mdx file everytime
