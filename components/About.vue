            <Hello />
            <p class="text-xl text-grey break-words font-regular">I've always loved computers and video games for as long as
                I can remember. <br>I've gone through various stages in the programming world, from working as a backend
                developer, also dealing with infrastructure and DevOps, to mastering <strong class="text-lime">fullstack development.</strong><br> Outside the
                world of technology, I have a beloved dog named Gaia, who I love to play outside with, when I'm not gaming, you can find me doing that, running or
                cycling, hobbies I've been increasingly passionate about.
